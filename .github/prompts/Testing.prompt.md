## Unit Testing Instructions

1. Use the `pytest` module to write unit tests.
2. Place all unit test files in the `tests/` directory.
3. Avoid using mocking; focus on testing actual functionality.
4. Execute all tests using `pytest` and resolve any errors or failures encountered.
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage in unit tests.
- Document how to run tests in the `README.md`.
